# Finny2
UCI Chess Program based on the PythonChess lib.

Next coding step: Wrap it as a LichessBot, add Negamax, etc.

Playing installations:
* Do **pip install python-chess** on your computer! And have **python3 installed**.
* Use the .exe (link following soon) for your UCI chess GUI
* Or clone and start the scripts (use uci, isready, ucinewgame, position startpos e2e4, go depth 4 to receive the bestmove answer to play by hand ;-)

**V.01:** Plays Random Moves. 
.exe is coming soon. Stockfish 10 needs 13 monves averate to mate it. Can you make it in under 20?!
