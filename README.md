# Finny
**Small UCI Chess Program based on the PythonChess lib and Python 3**

**Current Status:** Plays only random moves.

**Next coding step:** Wrap it as a LichessBot and make it stronger with AlphaBeta search.

**Playing installations:**
* Use the .exe for your UCI chess GUI and put it in your favourite UCI playing GUI as Arena.
* You can test the exe (or the bat / bash scripts below) if you start it in a shell. Then type each command with return: "uci"; "isready"; "ucinewgame"; "position startpos d2d4"; "go depth 4" and see the response as e.g. "bestmove g8f6".
*  If you want to clone the git repo or download the zip you need to have python3 installed and do *"pip install python-chess"* in the shell.
